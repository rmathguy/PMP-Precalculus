\section{\textbf{Real Numbers}}
This Chapter of the module is meant to help make sure the reader is comfortable with the idea of a \emph{Real Number} and all of the other Numbers that came before them and are a part of them.
It's also a refresher on some of the terminology that might differ from everyday usage and understanding. Mathematicians are very particular with their language and so will we in this text.

\subsection{What Numbers Do We Know?}%
\label{sub:What numbers do we know?}
\\\\

Throughout your current education, however you may have gotten it, you likely have learned about numbers. Specifically we can start with the idea of a counting number for instance:
\[
	1,2,3 \dots
\]
Mathematicians generally call these numbers \emph{Natural Numbers} because they are the `Most natural' numbers to first create. (Side-note, often-times and often not Mathematicians will include the 
number $0$ in the natural numbers. Though this depends on the area of math, and the mathematician!).

After the Natural numbers comes the extension to the \emph{Integers}. Which includes every counting number,
and the negative version of it. That is to say
\[
	\cdots -3, -2, -1 ,0 ,1 ,2 ,3 \dots
\]
This may not seem like such an important jump, but negative numbers were often avoided at all costs let alone able to exist on their own.

Once you have all of the integers what can you do with them? You likely know that you can add and subtract them just fine. And even multiply, but you cannot always divide, at least evenly that is. That's until we
modify our notion of dividing evenly.

We basically say in defiance, `Oh, you say I can't divide 3 by 2 evenly. Well watch me\dots it's $\frac{3}{2} $'. We do this for all divisions that could make sense \footnote{
That is to say, since dividing by 0 doesn't make sense, dividing any whole number by any other whole number that's not 0}
And there are many ways to represent this number,
such as it's decimal form $1.5$ or by writing $1\frac{1}{2} $ to mean that it is $1$ whole with an additional $\frac{1}{2} $. Although this mixed fraction is nicer to get an idea of size, it isn't very easy
to do arithmetic with, especially multiplication and division. For that reason we are going to stick with the from $\frac{3}{2} $ and keep this true for all other fractions that we might want to change
to mixed form.

Back on topic, what are we too call all of these divisions of integers? And does it fix the issue of division not always working? Firstly Mathematicians have settled on the name \emph{Rationals}
Because each of these numbers is Rational, meaning that it is the ratio of two whole numbers. Secondly: Yes! We'll see shorly the rules for dealing with fractions and these rational numbers. But as we will see
if we divide two rational numbers (so long as what we are dividing by is not zero) then we end up with a rational number again.

To be careful we are going to make a definition of what we mean by rational numbers:

\begin{defn}{\textbf{Rational Numbers}}
	A number, call it $r$ is said to be a \emph{Rational Number} if it can be expressed as the ratio of two integers:
	\[
	r = \frac{m}{n} 	
	\]
	Where $m,n$ are integers and $n\neq 0$
\end{defn}

This is great and all, but how does one work with this ratios and the fractions in general?

(Note: Because this is more meant to be a quick review we will not go in depth on why these rules are true. It is more meant to be a reminder, If you want to see why they come about Try some of the Algebra and Pre-Algebra
modules. There will be ones on Fractions made in the near future!)


\begin{alignat}{99}
	\frac{a}{b}  + \frac{c}{d} &= \frac{ad + bc}{bd} \qquad && \text{Addition Rule} \\
	\frac{a}{b}  - \frac{c}{d} &= \frac{ad - bc}{bd} \qquad && \text{Subtraction Rule} \\ 
	\frac{a}{b}  \times \frac{c}{d} &= \frac{ac}{bd} && \text{Multiplicaiton Rule} \\
	\frac{a}{b}  /  \frac{c}{d} = \frac{\frac{a}{b}}{\frac{c}{d}}  &= \frac{ad}{bc} && \text{Division Rule}
\end{alignat}

Now we can see that, indeed, dividing two rational numbers gives another one, same with all the other usual arithmetic operations.
